    "### What is COVID-19? \n",
    "This *infectious disease* is caused by **severe acute respiratory syndrom coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)**. Classified as a pandemic on March 11th 2020 by the WHO, the first recorded case of this virus infection was in Wuhan, China. *There still is a lot to learn about this novel virus.* While the majority of cases result in mild/recoverable symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and organ failure, and is seen to be more severe in elderly, or adults with underlying health risks such as diabetes, obesity, cardiac issues, etc. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### What are the symptoms?  \n",
    "Most commonly reported symptoms are shortness of breath, fever and a cough, *dry cough being reported more often*. Mucus production, muscle pain and sore throat are less common symptoms to note.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it spread?  \n",
    "Similar to influenza, the virus spreads from one person to others via respiratory droplets. \n",
